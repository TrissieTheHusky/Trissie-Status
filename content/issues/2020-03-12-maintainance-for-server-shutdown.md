***Resolved*** - Fix was implemented successfully. We are now ramping up the servers and will start allowing usage of our API, and Services. 
Thank you for your patience.

***Monitoring*** - We are currently monitoring a fix that we have implemented.

***Identified*** - We seem to have found the issue with our servers not wanting to start back up and are implementing a fix.

***Investigating* -** There is a problem with our services. There seems to be a issue with starting up the servers and propagating back to our main Websockets. 

***Update -*** Our servers have been shutdown. All of our services have propagated to the [Backup Gateway](https://statustrissiedevelopment.netlify.com/affected/backup-gateway/) Successfully. 

***Investigating*** - We are experiencing errors due to shutting down our servers. We are now implementing the fixes and updating firmware. As well as getting ready for total shutdown.

***Upcoming*** - We are going to be shutting down services for maintenance. We are shutting down for a test of our Backup Gateway.  We are sorry for any inconveniences, this may cause. We will keep you updated as we preform our actions.
